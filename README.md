## About the Project

Thanks for checking out Gardengineering!

This is a small passion project I’ve been building in my free time between assignments and classes. It’s created using block-based coding in TurboWarp — partly because I enjoy it, partly because I’m still learning JavaScript, and partly because it’s just fun.

The game is fully playable, but still actively in development. Many features are complete, and several more are planned before an official full release.

## Project Status

**Overall Completion: ~66%**

The core gameplay loop works, most foundational systems are implemented, and content is steadily expanding. Larger systems like prestige mechanics and day/night cycles are still in development.

# Systems

## Tile System – *~96% Complete*
Recognizes tiles and allows interaction with them.

### Planting System – 100%  
Plant crops directly onto tiles.

### Watering System – 100%  
Water crops so they can grow.

- **Water Bar – 100%**  
  Tracks available water.  
  *(Rates may be adjusted after further playtesting.)*

### Harvesting System – 100%  
Harvest crops. Machine-handled crops sell for slightly less.

### Machine System – 95%  
Place machines to automate farm tasks.

### Mulch System – 80%  
Apply mulch to add buffs to crops.

---

## Upgrade Tree System – 70% Complete
Purchase upgrades to improve gameplay efficiency.

### Tree 1 – Crops (100%)
- All upgrades functional and purchasable.

### Tree 2 – Garden (100%)
- All upgrades functional and purchasable.

### Tree 3 – Machines (95%)

### Reset / Prestige System (0%)
- Not started yet.
- Planned feature: reset farm and upgrades in exchange for prestige points that unlock permanent bonuses.

---

## Day / Night System – 0%
Planned feature that will introduce light mechanics and crop behavior changes.
