Hi, and thanks for looking (at least) at my project! Gardengineering is a small project I've been working using Turbowarp on in my free time in between assignments and classes, so your time means the world to me. 

This was made in block coding just because 1. im too lazy to actually work in a normal language, 2. i havent finished learning JS, and 3. I like scratch coding its fun

This game is 100 and a half percent A WORK IN PROGRESS. It's playable, but I have many more features I plan to add before a proper release.

Here's a list of systems that I have implemented and am working to add.

- Tile System (Recognize tiles, interact with them) [66%]
    - Planting System (Plant crops on tiles) [100%]
    - Watering System (Water tiles for crops to grow) [100%]
        - Water Bar (A tracking system for the amount of water you have) [100%] (may redo rates after playtesting for water refil and max water) 
    - Harvesting System (Harvest tiles, less money for machine handled crops) [90%]
    - Machine system (Place machines to do your work for you) [95%]
    - Mulch System (Place mulch to add buffs to your crops) [80%]
- Upgrade Tree System (Purchase upgrades to buff your gameplay) [70%]
        - Tree 1 (Crops) [100%]
                - All upgrades working and purchasable
        - Tree 2 (Garden) [100%]
                - All upgrades working and purchasable
        - Tree 3 (Machines) [90%]
        - Reset Upgrades [0%]
                - havent even started. Will reset farm and all upgrades for a prestige point of sorts that can upgrade permanant things on your farm.
- Day/Night system [0%]
