# Gardengineering

Hi, and thanks for looking (at least) at my project! Gardengineering is a small project I've been working on in my free time in between assignments and classes, so your time means the world to me. 

This game is 100 and a half percent A WORK IN PROGRESS. It's playable, but I have many more features I plan to add before a proper release.

Here's a list of systems that I have implemented and am working to add.

- Tile System (Recognize tiles, interact with them) [66%]
    - Planting System (Plant crops on tiles) [100%]
    - Watering System (Water tiles for crops to grow) [100%]
        - Water Bar (A tracking system for the amount of water you have) [100%] (may redo rates after playtesting for water refil and max water) 
    - Harvesting System (Harvest tiles, less money for machine handled crops) [50%]
    - Machine system (Place machines to do your work for you) [80%]
    - Mulch System (Place mulch to add buffs to your crops) [0%]
- Upgrade Tree System (Purchase upgrades to buff your gameplay) [50%]
        - Tree 1 (Crops) [100%]
                - All upgrades working and purchasable
        - Tree 2 (Garden) [100%]
                - All upgrades working and purchasable
        - Tree 3 (Machines) [0%]
        - Reset Upgrades [0%]
                - havent even started. Will reset farm and all upgrades for a prestige point of sorts that can upgrade permanant things on your farm.
- Day/Night system [0%]
